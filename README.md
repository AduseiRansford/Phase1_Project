OVERVIEW
Project - I was tasked to build a Suite Landing Page.

Project Objective - The aim of the project was to use HTML and CSS to build a Suite Landing Page. It was expected to look as similar as what was given me in the Figma design file.

Useful Links - I was tasked to use github to create a public repository to keep my project files and use either netlify, github pages or vercel to deploy it. I therefore
used github for the repository and vercel for my deployment.


METHODOLOGY
Application Used in Building the Project: I used Visual Studio Code for the coding process, Github Desktop Application for commiting and pushing my commits to my github account and Google Chrome for viewing my work.

What i learned - The project really broadened my knowledge in HTML and CSS styling. Before starting the project, I had to go through the project files carfeully to make sure I understood what was expected of me to do. In doing that, I had to note down the necessary elements stated in the project outline which include the font family, font sizes and colours etc. I then had to restructure the HTML in the index file before applying the CSS. This made it easy when styling. 
I also did a lot of research whenever I got lost and stranded. Websites like freecodecamp, w3schools and youtube were very much useful.
It was obvious that whatever I learnt during my training session on freecodecamp was essential in executing this project. Despite the challenges i faced during the project, I enjoyed building it. This has helped me to get more insight about a lot of things in HTML and CSS. 
I would like to thank Amalitech for this opportunity so far and looking forward to more of this.
Thank you!
